# VMEDIA Proxy Server

This project is a proxy server built using the NestJS framework. It retrieves content from a given website, modifies the content by adding the "â„¢" symbol to every six-letter word, and ensures that all internal navigation links point to the proxy server itself. The application also maintains the functionality of the original site, including images and other resources.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18.x recommended)
- npm (v8.x recommended)
